Art.com Style Guide
=========

## What's this?
This is a style guide! It's a living, breathing resource that designers and developers can use when creating new products. It originated as a way to document our current site styles and assets, but moving forward we can use it as a starting point for all design and development.

**But wait, what if we want to design something different than what's on the style guide?**

Well, in all reality, we should be minimizing the visual differences on our site. Think of these assets as building blocks for design. Any deviation from the style-guide should be a last resort, and as we strive for a more cohesive guide, (ultimately an accepted, integrated guide) these deviations will become less and less frequent. On those infrequent occasions, we will add the new elements into the style guide for future use.
